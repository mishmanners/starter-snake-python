Even though it's called "Summer", it's winter here in Australia. The Battlesnake Summer League ran over the month of July in 2021.

**Sneki Snek** ended the Summer League place in Gold Ranking. He was just outside the top 100, possibly due to the Replit breaking. Note to self: remember to consistently check Replit account to ensure the server is online!

Well done Sneki Snek :partying_face:
